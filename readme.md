# apply-html

[![NPM version][npm-img]][npm-url] [![Downloads][downloads-img]][npm-url] [![Build Status][travis-img]][travis-url] [![Coverage Status][coveralls-img]][coveralls-url]

It's `.innerHTML = ''` for the modern world. Diffs and patches an existing DOM element by [efficiently comparing it](#why) to a string.

## Install

```command
$ npm install --save apply-html
```

## Usage

### Patching

```js
const { html, apply } = require('apply-html');

const content = html`
    <h1>Hello <em>World</em></h1>
`;

apply(document.body, content);
```

### Interpolation

```js
const { html, raw, apply } = require('apply-html');

const state = {
    salutation: 'Hello',
    target: '<em>World</em>'
};

const template = ({ salutation, target }) => html`
    <h1>${salutation} ${raw(target)}</h1>
`;

apply(document.body, template(state));
// document.body.innerHTML = template(state);

console.log(document.body.innerHTML);
// -> <h1>Hello <em>World</em></h1>
```

### Server-side rendering

The `html` and `raw` functions return [`SafeString`](#safestring)s which work great in Node.

```js
const http = require('http');
const { html } = require('apply-html');

const content = html`
    <h1>Hello <em>World</em></h1>
`;

http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.end(content.toString());
}).listen(3000);
```

## Why?

I wanted the rendering simplicity of setting an element's `innerHTML` property coupled with the benefits of DOM diffing and patching. There are many libraries that do this sort of thing, so why another? Custom elements.

Most existing solutions for diffing and patching either replace the DOM with their own virtual representations ([`react`](http://npm.im/react), [`vdom`](http://npm.im/vdom), [`hyperscript`](http://npm.im/hyperscript)) or by diffing two live DOM trees ([`bel`](http://npm.im/bel), [`morphdom`](http://npm.im/morphdom), [`diff-dom`](http://npm.im/diff-dom)). Most of these libraries suffer the same issue in that they call a custom element's constructor before the elements are attached to the DOM for the first time leading to unexpected side effects and forcing constructor logic into the `connectedCallback`.

This library is a little bit different. It makes use of an [HTML `<template>`'s](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template) ability to create an inert document fragment. These fragments are full, diffable, DOM trees, but have the added benefit of not triggering resource loading or custom element lifecycle callbacks. This inert document fragment is compared to the live DOM element with [`nanomorph`](http://npm.im/nanomorph), a tiny modern DOM patching utility that operates on given DOM trees.

Thus, `apply-html` ensures that things only start happening if and when they're supposed to. For more information, see the [original CodePen](https://codepen.io/shannonmoeller/pen/opEdpe?editors=0010).

## API

### `` html`string`: SafeString ``

A template tag that creates a new [SafeString](#safestring) containing a string of HTML. Interpolated values are serialized based on type:

- `Boolean|null|undefined` - Converted to an empty string (`''`).
- `Array` - Items are serialized then joined with an empty string (`''`).
- `Object` - Converted to HTML-escaped JSON blobs.
- `String` - Literal strings will be HTML-escaped to safeguard against [XSS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_(XSS)). To opt out of escaping, use [`raw()`](#rawstring-safestring).
- `SafeString` - Inserted as-is.

### `raw(string): SafeString`

- `string` `{String}` String of safe HTML.

Wraps a string with a [SafeString](#safestring) to indicate that it's safe to be inserted into the document. Only use on trusted strings to safeguard against [XSS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_(XSS)). 

### `apply(element, string): element`

- `element` `{Element}` HTML element with children to be patched.
- `string` `{String|SafeString}` String or [SafeString](#safestring) containing safe HTML to render.

Updates the content of the given element, making the fewest possible changes required to match the given string of HTML. Returns the element after all changes have been applied.

## SafeString

### `new SafeString(string)`

Wraps a string to indicate that the string is safe to be inserted into the document. Only use on trusted strings to safeguard against [XSS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_(XSS)).

### SafeString Properties

#### `.raw` `{String}`

The wrapped string.

### SafeString Methods

#### `.toJSON(): String`

Returns the raw string.

#### `.toString(): String`

Returns the raw string.
